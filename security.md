# how to detect phishing (1)

- opening the wrong website
    - Good: paypal email opens paypal.com
    - Bad: paypal email opens paypal.**info-pp.jp**

# how to detect phishing (2)

- sketchy formatting
- not personalized: `Dear sir/madam` instead of your name
- sometimes: requires immediate action
- attachment that you supposed to immediately open and review

---

# counter-measures

- awareness (so, this talk)
- check sender, etc.
- if immediate action is required, do not follow the links in the email, just go to the service directly
- additional security measures on the mail server

---

- _contains patient data or access to patient data_

- never leave your laptop unattended
- in the new office: personal lockers
